## ⚠️ Important: How to Run

**This application CANNOT be opened by double-clicking `index.html`**  
It requires a development server or build process to work correctly.

### Development Mode (Recommended)

**Prerequisites:**  Node.js (v14 or higher)

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. (Optional) Set the `GEMINI_API_KEY` in [.env.local](.env.local) to your Gemini API key

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open your browser to: **http://localhost:3000**

### Production Build

1. Build the application:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Preview the production build:
   ```bash
   npm run preview
   ```

3. Open your browser to: **http://localhost:4173**

## Deployment

For production deployment, use the `dist` folder generated by `npm run build`.

**Recommended platforms:**
- **Vercel**: Connect repository, build command: `npm run build`, output: `dist`
- **Netlify**: Connect repository, build command: `npm run build`, output: `dist`
- **GitHub Pages**: Build locally with `npm run build`, then deploy the `dist` folder to `gh-pages` branch or use GitHub Actions for automated builds

## Troubleshooting

**Black screen when opening the site?**
- Make sure you're running `npm run dev` or `npm run preview`
- Don't open `index.html` directly in the browser
- Check that all dependencies are installed with `npm install`
